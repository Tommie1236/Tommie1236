<h1 align="center"> Hi</h1>


<p align="center">I'm a student and I like to code in my free time.<br>
I'm most experienced (and like it the most) in Python but also have experience with other languages.<br>
I like backend/cli based projects the most but also like to do some design work from time to time. (not very good at that though.)</p>

<h3 align="center">Projects </h3>
<p align="center"> I have some projects in my private account but most are made in collaboration with some other amazing people. <br>
They can be found here:</p>
<ul align="center">

  <li><a href="https://www.github.com/hybridlights">HybridLights</a></li>
</ul>


<h3 align="center">Collaboration </h3>
<p align="center">I'm open to colaborate with other people. <br> If you'r creating a project and want some help, feel free to reach out to the email down below or tag me on github.
